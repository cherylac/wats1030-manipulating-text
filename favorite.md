# H1 My favorite Editor

I think my favorite text editor out of the three at this point is EMACS. Perhaps because it is the last one I used to complete this project, so it is most fresh in my mind, but also because it seemed to have more command than Nano and seemed to flow pretty well while I was using it. My least favorite was, of course, Vi, which was very cumbersome to use. Not being able to just scroll around using the arrow key like you can in EMACS and Nano was annoying, and being mode based adds extra steps. What I did like about Vi was that I was able to find a command to easily count the frequence of a word, which I was unable to find in the other two. Editing seemed easiest in EMACs. I definitely had to rely on my cheatsheats and resources while working with each one.
